# turbo-garbanzo

A small Android project — README was empty/malformed. This file adds a short description and fixes a broken dependency line.

## Fix

The previous README contained a truncated Gradle dependency. Replace it with the correct AndroidX CardView dependency:

Add to your module-level build.gradle (or Gradle Kotlin DSL equivalent):

```gradle
implementation "androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0"
```

(Use version 1.0.0 or a newer compatible version depending on your project.)

## Project

This repository appears to be an Android project. If you want me to:
- add a proper build.gradle / Gradle files,
- add CI configuration (GitHub Actions),
- add example code or a sample Activity using CardView,
I can create those files and push them. Tell me which you'd like.
